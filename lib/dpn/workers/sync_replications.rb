        # The algorithm is:
        # 1. local node issues GET bag registry data from remote node. This
        #    is the responsibility of DPN::Workers::SyncBags and it is assumed
        #    that this will run async to this process.  So it is assumed here
        #    that a query on the local node for bags owned by the remote node
        #    will return data that is eventually consistent.
        # 2. local node iterates through the bag data that belongs to remote node
        #    from (1), to GET related replication_request data from remote node.
        # 3. Some of the replication_request data from (2) may create (POST)
        #    new data to the local node and some of it may update (PUT)
        #    existing data on the local node.
        # 4. The local node only ever updates (PUT) the local copy of the
        #    replication data using data from the remote node.  If the local
        #    node acts on the replication request and needs to update the
        #    replication data, it must PUT on the remote node.  The next
        #    time this sync runs, it will then update the local copy.
